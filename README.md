üöß **Work in Progress** üöß  
Trueno is currently under active development. Features may change, and documentation will be updated accordingly.

Trueno is a rapid, keyboard-friendly API testing tool. Poke around APIs without ever lifting your hands off the keyboard. Designed to handle multi-project setups seamlessly, Trueno also comes equipped with scripting capabilities for custom request behaviors.

Born out of the necessity to protect user data and maintain privacy, Trueno is a simplified but capable alternative to tools like Postman or Insomnia. While other tools force you to create an account and store data in the cloud, Trueno ensures that all your data remains locally stored on your own device. This approach not only safeguards against potential data breaches but also gives users full control and ownership over their information.

## üåü Features
- **Secure:** All data stored locally.
- **Keyboard-centric:** Navigate and execute requests without switching to your mouse.
- **Multi-Project Support:** Juggle multiple APIs without losing your sanity.
- **Not Slow:** Quick startup and low latency during use.
- **Scriptable:** Customize request behaviors with scripts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage
(More detailed documentation coming soon...)

### General Tips
- `Space`: Open fuzzy finder.
- `Tab` or `Arrow keys`: Navigate fuzzy finder results.
- `Enter`: Execute selected result.
- `Esc`: Close fuzzy finder.
  
### Working with Scripts
- Scripts receive an object called `data`.
- `Right-click` to inspect the web window for script debugging.
- `console.log(data)` for initial debugging to see available variables.
  
### Templating
- Use `{ENV_KEY}` in request fields to pull in data from the environment.
- Escape `{` with `!{`.
